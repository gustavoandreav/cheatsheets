DEB
###
A DEB file is a software package that is used by linux distributions that are
based on Debian, like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Deepin, AntiX, Kali and so many more.
The deb files are most commonly used to update or install UNIX applications. The
file itself contains two files with .tar extension. One is for installable and
the other is for installer control information.

For performing various tasks on .deb files like installing, removing, checking,
etc, we need a package manager. Debian-related files have dpkg as their package
manager (dkpg stands for Debian Package).

RPM
###
RPM file is a software package that is used by linux distributions based on Red
Hat Linux, like Fedora, Rocky, Alma, CentOS, and many more. Infact RPM itself 
is an abbreviation for Red Hat Package Manager. Just like dpkg is the package
manager for deb, the package manager for RPM is RPM itself.

RPM was created 25 years ago, and is used in many linux distros like clearOS,
Alma Linux, CentOS, openSUSE, Oracle Linux, Fedora, OpenMandriva, rocky linux 
and so many other distros based on Red Hat Linux.

RPM works only on packages that are built on .rpm format. The tool allows users
to update, installm query, check, uninstall and manage system software in 
UNIX/Linux operating systems derived from Red Hat.
