Snap is a software packaging and deployment system delevoped by Canonical for 
OS that use the Linux kernel and the systemd init system.

The packages, called snaps, and the tool for using them, snapd, work across a
range of linux distros and allow upstream software developers to distribute 
their applications directly to users.
Snaps are self-contained applications running in a sandbox wth mediated access
to the host system. Snap was originally released for cloud applications but was
later ported to also work for IoT devices and desktop applications.

Snap Store
##########
The Snap Store allows developers to publish their snap-packaged applications.
All aps uploaded to the Snap Store undergo automatic testing, including a 
malware scan. However, the scan does not catch all issues. In 2018, 2 
applications by the same developer were found to contains a cryptocurrency 
miner which ran in the background during application execution.

Universal Linux packages
########################
Snaps are self-contained packages that work across a range of linux distros. 
This is unlike traditional linux package management approaches, which require
specifically adapted packages for each Linux distro.
The snap file format is a single compressed filesystem using the SquashFS 
format with the extension .snap
This filesystem contains the application, libraries it depends on, and
declarative metadata. This metadata is interpreted by snapd to set up an 
appropriately shaped secure sandbox for that application. After installation,
the snap is mounted by the host OS and decompressed on the fly when the files
are used.
Although this has the advantage that snaps use less disk space, it also means
some large applications start more slowly.

A significant difference between Snap and other universal Linux packaging 
formats such as Flatpak is that Snap supports any class of Linux application
such as desktop applications, server tools, IoT apps and even system services
such as the printer driver stack.
To ensure this, Snap relies on systemd for features such as running 
socket-activated system services in a Snap. This causes Snap to work best only
on distributions that can adopt thatt init system.

Configurable sandbox
####################
Applications in a Snap run in a container with limited access to the host 
system. Using interfaces, users can give an application mediated access to 
additional features of the host such as recording audio, accessing USB devices
and recording vieo.

Snapcraft
#########
It is a tool for developers to package their programs in the Snap format.
It runs on any linux distro supported by Snap, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.
Snapcraft builds the packages in a VM using Multipass.
Snapcraft supports multiple build tools and programming languages, such as Go, 
Java, JavaScript, Python, C/C++, and Rust. It also allows importing application
metadata from multiple sources such as AppStream, git, shell scripts and 
setup.py files.
