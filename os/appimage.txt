AppImage is a format for distributnig portable software on Linux without needing
superuser permissions to install the application. It tries also to allow Linux
distribution-agnostic binary software deployment for the application developers,
also called upstream packaging.
Released in 2004 under the name klik, then in 2011 became PortableLinuxApps, 
and later in 2013 finally got the name of AppImage

Objectives
##########
AppImage aims to be an application deployment system for Linux with the 
following objectives: simplicity, binary compatibility, portability, distro
agnosticism, no installation, no root permission, and keeping the underlying OS
untouched.

Properties
##########
AppImage dos not install the application in the traditional Linux sense. Instead
of putting the application's various files in the distro's appropriate places in
the file system, the AppImage file is just the application's compressed image.
When it runs, the file is mounted with FUSE. This behavior is consistent with
AppImage's predecessors, klik and PortableLinuxApps.

It uses one file per application. Each file is self-contained: it includes all
libraries the application depends on that are not already part of the targeted
base-system. An AppImage version 1.0 is an ISO 9660 Rock Ridge file containing
a minimal AppDir and a tiny runtime. An AppImage application can be added to a 
live CD by adding only one file to the live CD.

AppImage files are simpler than installing an application. No extraction tools
are needed, nor is it necessary to modify the operating system or user 
environment. Regular users on the common Linux distributions can download it,
make it executable, and run it.

AppImage allows generation of embedded digital signature, which need to be 
verified with an external utility. The format does not offer form of self-check
with package authenticity verification or runtime confinement by sandboxing.
