Also known as xdg-app until May 2016, is an utility for software deployment and package
management for Linux. It is advertised as offering a sandbox environment in which users
can run application software in isolation from the rest of the system.


Features
########

Applications using Flatpak need permisions to have access to resources such as Blueetoth,
sound (with PulseAudio), network, and files. These permissions are configured by the
maintainer of the Flatpak and can be added or removed by users on their system.

Another key feature of Flatpak is that it allows application developers to directly
provide updates to users without going through distributions, and without having to 
package and test the application separately for each distribution.

Flathub, a repository (or remote source in Flatpak terminology) located at flathub.org,
has become the de facto standard for getting applications packages with Flatpak. Packages
are added to it by both the Flathub administrators and the developers of the programs
themselves.

Flatpak runs in a sandbox, and that means that it will always use more space on the
systems than common native packages. However, this is not a concern as Flatpak uses 
OSTree as its backend which can deduplicate matching files. This means that the first
install of a Flatpak application will always take up more space at first, but will be
more efficient as the users installs more Flatpak packages.

Support
#######

Theoretically, Flatpak apps can be installed on any existing and future Linux distro,
including those installed with the Windows Subsystem for Linux compatibility layer, so
long as bubblewrap and OSTree are available.
It can also be used on Linux Kernel based systems like ChromeOS.
