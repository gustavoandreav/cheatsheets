APT (Advanced Package Tool) is a free software user interface for Debian and 
Debian-based Linux distributions that interacts with core libraries to handle
program installation and removal. APT is a package that contains a set of 
utilities called apt. A large component of APT is specified in a C++ function
library; APT also contains command-line applications for interacting with 
packages that utilize the library. Apt, apt-get, and apt-cache are three such
applications. 
Because they are easy and common, they are frequently used in examples. In all
current Debian versions, the apt package has "important" priority and is thus
included in a basic Debian installation. APT is front-end to dpkg that is more
user-friendly that the earlier select front-end. While dpkg handles individual
package activities, APT handles package relationships (particularly 
dependencies) as well as the sourcing and administration of higher-level 
versioning choices.
